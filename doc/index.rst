Pygame Zero : Plaformer tutorial
================================

In this tutorial we'll use Pygame Zero to create a platformer, where
you can test your running and jumping skills and design your own
levels.

We'll use the final version of our `Pac-Man tutorial`_ as a starting
point because this game has many of the things we'll need for our
game. Don't worry, you can change the sprites if you find it a bit odd
that Pac-Man is now in a platformer!

It is probably a good idea to go and do the `Pac-Man tutorial`_ if you
haven't already done so, then it will be easier to understand what
we are doing in this tutorial, but you don't have to if you'd prefer
to jump straight in. 

If you've not yet set up Pygame Zero and the editor Mu, head over to
the Flappy Bird Tutorial and follow the instructions there:

If you're new to Python programming then that Flappy Bird tutorial is
probably better place to start -- this tutorial is significantly
harder.
